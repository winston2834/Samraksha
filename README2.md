  *** Samraksha – Community-Powered Environmental Platform ***

Samraksha is a community-powered digital platform focused on environmental protection and responsible waste management.
The core idea is simple but powerful:

Citizens often see waste issues but don’t know where or how to report
Authorities lack real-time, location-based data
People want to help the environment but lack guidance and awareness
Samraksha bridges this gap by:
Allowing users to report waste-related problems
Tracking real-time location
Providing educational resources
Offering a chatbot for instant help and easy navigation
Encouraging community participation

This platform transforms passive citizens into active environmental protectors.
